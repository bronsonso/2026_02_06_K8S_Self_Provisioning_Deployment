## 1. Executive Summary

<details>
<summary><strong>1.1 Project Background</strong></summary>

> This project addresses the modernization of our legacy application hosting infrastructure, which currently consists of approximately 700 systems distributed across KVM virtual machines and OpenVZ containers. The existing environment operates on disparate technologies with varying lifecycle stages, leading to operational inefficiencies, rising maintenance costs, and limited scalability. As business demands evolve, the current infrastructure cannot adequately support emerging requirements for rapid deployment, elastic scaling, and developer self-service capabilities. This initiative represents a strategic transformation to establish a unified, modern platform that aligns with industry best practices and positions the organization for future growth.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>1.2 Business Objectives ✅</strong></summary>

> - **Cost Optimization**: Reduce total cost of ownership by 30% through infrastructure consolidation and improved resource utilization via Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI)
> - **Operational Efficiency**: Decrease application deployment time from days to minutes through containerization and Kubernetes orchestration
> - **Scalability & Agility**: Establish a platform capable of supporting 200% growth over the next three years with automated scaling capabilities
> - **Security & Compliance**: Achieve ISO 27001 compliance for the new platform while implementing Zero Trust security principles
> - **Developer Productivity**: Enable self-service provisioning through GitOps workflows, reducing infrastructure dependencies by 70%

We're implementing a production-ready infrastructure platform that leverages Harvester HCI to create a unified virtualization and container environment on 5 Dell R610 servers. The solution provides both VM and Kubernetes capabilities through a single management interface, with Rancher for multi-cluster orchestration and RKE2 for enterprise-grade Kubernetes.

**Adoption Strategy**: 80% container, 20% VM
- Legacy systems → Harvester VMs
- Modern applications → RKE2 clusters

**Key Features**:
- Built-in security compliance
- VM and container scaling
- Infrastructure-as-Code support
- GitOps pipelines
- Developer self-service capabilities

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Why 3 databases for Kubernetes?</strong></summary>

Kubernetes typically uses three database components for high availability and data separation:

1. **etcd**: The primary distributed key-value store for Kubernetes cluster state
2. **Container Registry Database**: For storing container image metadata
3. **Monitoring/Logging Database**: For metrics and logs (Prometheus, Loki, etc.)

This separation ensures:
- Isolation of concerns
- Independent scaling
- Different backup strategies
- Reduced single points of failure

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can namespaces have inheritance in Kubernetes?</strong></summary>

**No**, Kubernetes namespaces do not support inheritance natively. However, you can achieve similar outcomes through:

1. **Helm Chart Dependencies**: Parent charts that include child configurations
2. **Kustomize Overlays**: Base configurations with environment-specific patches
3. **Policy Propagation Tools**: Using tools like Kyverno or OPA Gatekeeper to propagate policies
4. **GitOps Patterns**: Template repositories that generate namespace configurations
5. **Operators**: Custom operators that manage namespace hierarchies

Best practice is to use a combination of GitOps and policy tools rather than relying on native inheritance.
